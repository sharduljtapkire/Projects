## 1. Chat Application (Client-Server) üí¨

### Description

This project implements a simple **client-server chat application** using **Java Swing** for the graphical user interface and standard Java networking. It enables real-time message exchange between a single client and a server. A key feature is the client's ability to log all chat history to a timestamped text file for record-keeping.

### Features
* **Real-time Messaging:** Exchange messages between client and server.
* **GUI Interface:** User-friendly Swing interfaces for both client and server.
* **Chat History Logging (Client-side):** All messages are logged to a timestamped file (`ChatHistory_Client_YYYYMMDD_HHmmss.txt`).
* **Graceful Termination:** Client can end the session via an "End Chat" button or by typing "bye."

### Technical Details
* **Server (`ChatServerX.java`):** Uses `ServerSocket` and `Socket` on port `12345`.
* **Client (`ChatClientX.java`):** Connects to `localhost:12345`.
* **Communication:** `PrintWriter` and `BufferedReader` for text exchange.

### Limitations & Enhancements
* **Limitation:** Single-client only (no multithreading).
* **Future:** Multi-client support, improved UI, usernames, and robust error handling.
